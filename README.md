Tracing interoperability across bioinformatics databases and workflows.

Documentation: https://thatmariia.github.io/interop_trace/

## Purpose

A research software project for empirically testing interoperability across bioinformatics databases and workflows. It runs controlled database–workflow configurations against reference benchmarks, traces where interoperability succeeds or breaks, and produces evidence about the causes of incompatibility.


## Purpose Categories

- Integration & interfacing
- Data analysis

## Research Topics

- [bioinformatics](http://edamontology.org/topic_0091) - [database management](http://edamontology.org/topic_3489) - [proteomics](http://edamontology.org/topic_0121)

## Installation

Install from a source checkout:
